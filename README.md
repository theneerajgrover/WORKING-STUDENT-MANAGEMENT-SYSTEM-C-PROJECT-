# WORKING_STUDENT_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM_(C-PROJECT)
The Student Management System is a simple yet fully functional mini-project developed in the C programming language. It is designed to help beginners understand the practical implementation of structures, arrays, loops, and conditional statements in C while building a useful, real-world style application. This project provides an interactive console-based interface that allows the user to store and manage student records efficiently without the use of any external files or databases.

The system maintains student information such as roll number, name, and marks. These details are stored in an array of structures, making it easy to access and modify individual records. The project consists of five primary operations: Add Student, View Students, Search Student, Update Marks, and Delete Student. These functions work together to form a complete management system suitable for academic learning and demonstration purposes.

The Add Student feature lets the user input a new student’s roll number, name, and marks. Each new record is stored in the next available index of the structure array. The system keeps track of the total number of students using a counter variable, ensuring new entries do not overwrite existing ones.

The View Students option displays a list of all stored students. It shows each student’s roll number, full name, and marks in a clean and readable format. This helps the user verify entries and review the recorded data at any time. If no students are available, the system clearly indicates that the student list is empty.

The Search Student function allows the user to find a particular student by entering their roll number. The system scans through the array, and if a matching roll number is found, it displays the corresponding student’s details. This is a highly useful operation for quick lookups and ensures accuracy when updating or checking individual records.

The Update Marks feature enables the user to modify the marks of a student identified by their roll number. This reflects real-world situations where student performance records may need corrections or updates. Once updated, the system confirms the change to the user.

The Delete Student option lets the user remove a student’s record from the system. When a record is deleted, all subsequent records are shifted one position left to maintain continuity in the array. This ensures the database remains organized without leaving empty gaps.

Overall, the Student Management System is a strong beginner-level C project that covers core programming concepts such as arrays, structures, functions, loops, and user input handling. It provides a practical demonstration of how data can be stored, accessed, and managed in memory without file handling. This project is ideal for students who are new to C programming and want to build a working application that is simple, understandable, and meaningful. It also serves as an excellent addition to academic submissions, practical exams, and portfolio demonstrations.
